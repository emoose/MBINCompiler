## Installation

Whilst MBINCompiler can be run as a standalone file, it is possible to set up MBINCompiler so that any application can understand its name by using the `register` function of MBINCompiler.

To register MBINCompiler, open the folder where MBINCompiler has been placed, and open a command line window with administrator rights in that location.
Enter

```
MBINCompiler.exe register
```

If no errors occurs, you can close the command window and open another one.

Entering `MBINCompiler` should bring up the `help` information.
